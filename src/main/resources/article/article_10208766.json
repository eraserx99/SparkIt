(AP)  Jason Day shot a 2-under 69 at the BMW Championship, good enough to take a six-stroke lead into the final round.<\/p><p>Instead of running away from the field, as he had in the first two rounds after shooting 61 and 63, Day spent most of Saturday running in place. He made his first bogey in 20 holes at the sixth, then piled on three more to offset a half-dozen birdies. He wasn't alone struggling to stay consistent in cool, windy conditions at Conway Farms.<\/p><p>While the pack pursuing the FedEx Cup leader got no closer, there was a reshuffling of names. Scott Piercy moved up four spots from sixth into second place alongside rookie Daniel Berger.

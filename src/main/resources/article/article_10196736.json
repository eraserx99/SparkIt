(AP)  With a chance to make history, Jason Day made par instead on the final hole of his rain-delayed first round for a career-best 61 and a four-shot lead at the BMW Championship.<\/p><p>Day returned to Conway Farms early Friday needing to hole a 44-yard wedge shot from the rough for an eagle and a PGA Tour record-tying 59. His low-running pitch into the ninth green skidded to a stop 10 feet short of the cup. He then lipped out the birdie attempt.<\/p><p>His 10-under total left him clear of a pack of five players at 65, including Jordan Spieth, Bubba Watson and newcomer Daniel Berger.

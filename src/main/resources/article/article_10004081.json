(AP)  U.S. Solheim Cup captain Juli Inkster won The Legends Championship on Sunday, finishing with a 4-under 68 for a two-stroke victory over Trish Johnson.<\/p><p>''If a 55-year-old can win, they can, too,'' Inkster said about her Solheim Cup team that will face Europe in Germany on Sept. 18-20. ''This has been a tough year, and I'm really tired right now. I have an outing Tuesday in Detroit, then I'll be home for a week.''<\/p><p>The Hall of Famer had a 5-under 139 total after opening with a 71 on French Lick Resort's Pete Dye Course.<\/p><p>''I wasn't playing very well on the front side, but I birdied 13, 15, 17 and 18,'' Inkster said. ''That won the tournament for me. I stayed patient and started hitting it a lot better. I had no idea where I was in the tournament. I just tried to keep making birdies. It was good to win. I feel good.''<\/p><p>The 31-time LPGA winner earned $37,500 for her first Legends Tour victory.<\/p><p>Johnson bogeyed the final hole for a 70.<\/p><p>Pat Hurst and Lorie Kane tied for third.

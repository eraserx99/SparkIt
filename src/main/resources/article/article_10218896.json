(AP)  Jason Day won the BMW Championship on cruise control Sunday with a mostly stress-free final round of 2-under 69 that vaulted him into the top spot in the world ranking.<\/p><p>The Australian zoomed out to a big lead by shooting 61 and 63 in the first two rounds at Conway Farms and was never seriously challenged after that. His 22-under total was the second-lowest on tour this year good for a six-shot victory over rookie Daniel Berger. Scott Piercy finished third, seven strokes back.<\/p><p>The win Sunday was Day's fifth of the season and his second in the FedEx Cup playoffs. He heads to the series finale at East Lake in Atlanta next week as the front-runner in the 30-man field. He also leap-frogged Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy in the bargain to claim the No. 1 spot in the world ranking.<\/p>","category_term":"9048","subcategory_term":null,"subcategory":null,"author_ref":null,"article_source":"AP","images_ref":["10218881","10218886","10218891"],"video_ref":null,"autoplay_video":"0","image_or_video":"0","caption":null,"credit":null,"related_content_ref":null,"enable_article_collection":null,"article_collection_ref":[],"incremental_type":null,"starting_number":null,"jump_links":null,"article_seo_path":null,"tags":"Golf","ad_tags":"","people_ref":[],"events_ref":[],"publish_date":"2015-09-20 18:09:12","updated_date":"2015-09-20 18:30:00","syndication":"1","not_searchable":"0","disable_comments":"0","comments":null,"legacy_id":"20150920180826698582808","contributors_ref":null,"eyebrow":null,"galleries_ref":[],"url_alias":"golf\/2015\/09\/20\/ap-glf-bmw-championships"}
